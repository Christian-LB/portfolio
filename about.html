          About me
        </h1>
        <p class="p1">
          Hello, I am a 27-year-old student at St. Dominic College of Asia, currently pursuing a degree in BSIT because of my passion 
          for computers and technology. I have always been interested in how computers work, which is why I chose this field of 
          study. Throughout my academic journey, I have been learning various programming languages, including C, Java, Android 
          Studio, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have also earned certifications in Microsoft Word Specialist, Microsoft PowerPoint
           Specialist, and an IT Specialist Certificate in Java. When I am not focused on schoolwork, I spend my free time lifting
            weights, playing mobile games, and coding.
        <br><br>
          In the future, I aspire to work as a computer programmer or a software/web designer. I want to develop applications,
           websites, or software that can make tasks more efficient and user-friendly. To achieve this goal, I am continuously
            improving my programming skills and exploring new technologies. I believe that with hard work and dedication,
             I can build a successful career in the IT industry.
